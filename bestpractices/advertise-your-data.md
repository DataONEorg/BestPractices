To make your data available using standard and open software tools you should:

- Use standard language and terms to clearly communicate to others that your data are available for reuse and that you expect ethical and appropriate use of your data

- Use an open source datacasting (RSS or other type) service that enables you to advertise your data and the options for others to obtain access to it (RSS, GeoRSS, DatacastingRSS)
