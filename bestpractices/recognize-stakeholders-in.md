When creating the data management plan, review all who may have a stake in the data so future users of the data can easily track who may need to give permission. Possible stakeholders include but are not limited to:

-Funding body
-Host institution for the project
-Home institution of contributing researchers
-Repository where the data are deposited

It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists and provide appropriate citation and acknowledgment for subsequent distribution or publication of any work derived from stakeholder datasets. Data users are encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration, or co-authorship with original investigators.

## Description Rationale

Researchers are more willing to share their data if they are receive appropriate recognition for their contributions, and project sponsors, host institutions, data repositories, and researchersâ€™ home institution may all have a stake in data ownership and require acknowledgment.
