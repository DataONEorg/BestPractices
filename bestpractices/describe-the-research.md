## Best Practice
The research project description should contain the following information:

- Who: project personnel (principal investigator, researchers, technicians, others)
- Where: location and description of study site or sites
- When: range of dates for the project
- Why: rational for the project (abstract)
- How: description of project methods
Other useful information might include the project title, the overarching project (if any), institution(s) involved, and source of funding.

## Description Rationale
The project description provides essential background information and context for the dataset.
