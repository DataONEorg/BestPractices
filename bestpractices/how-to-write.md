## Filename

Each file is named as the first three words of the title, separated by dashes.
This page's title is "How to write a best practice", therefore the filename is
`how-to-write.md`.

## Header

The header for best practices has the following fields:

`title`: the title of the webpage, as it will appear in the lists

`layout`: is always `bestpractice` (*NB* this will likely be done automatically using the collections features from jekyll)

`tags`: a list of (short) keywords describing the content of the best practice text

`step`: a list of one or more steps of the data lifecycle to which this best practice applies

`related`: a list of related best practices identifiers -- an identifier is the first three words of the title, separated by dashes (optional)
