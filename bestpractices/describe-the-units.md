## Best Practice

The units of reported parameters need to be explicitly stated in the data file and in the documentation. We recommend SI units (The International System of Units) but recognize that each discipline has its own commonly used units of measure. The critical aspect here is that the units be defined so that others understand what is reported.

Do not use abbreviations when describing the units. For example the units for respiration are moles of carbon dioxide per meter squared per year.

## Related Best Practices
- Choose and use standard terminology to enable discovery
- Consider the compatibility of the data you are integrating
- Use consistent codes
