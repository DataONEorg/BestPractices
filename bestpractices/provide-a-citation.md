For appropriate attribution and provenance of a dataset, the following
information should be included in the data documentation or the companion
metadata file:

- Name the people responsible for the dataset throughout the lifetime of the dataset, including for each person:
  - Name
  - Contact information
  - Role (e.g., principal investigator, technician, data manager)

According to the International Polar Year Data and Information Service, an
author is the individual(s) whose intellectual work, such as a particular field
experiment or algorithm, led to the creation of the dataset. People responsible
for the data can include: individuals, groups, compilers or editors.

- Description of the context of the dataset with respect to a larger project or
study (include links and related documentation), if applicable.
- Revision history, including additions of new data and error corrections. Links to source
data, if the data in one dataset were derived from data in another dataset.
- List of project support (e.g., funding agencies, collaborators, material support).
- Describe how to properly cite the dataset. The data citation should include:
  - All contributors
  - date of dataset publication
  - Title of dataset
  - media or URL
  - Data publisher
  - Identifier (Digital Object Identifier)

## Description Rationale

Documenting the dataset origin, history, and contact information allows for
proper citation of datasets. By encouraging the proper citation of datasets,
data providers and publishers receive appropriate credit for their efforts.

## Additional Information

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center has guidance and rational for citing data sets:
