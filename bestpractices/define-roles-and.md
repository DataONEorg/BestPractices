## Best Practice
In addition to the primary researcher(s), there might be others involved in the research process that take part in aspects of data management. By clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, data are more likely to be available for use by the primary researchers and anyone re-using the data. Roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined, rather than assumed; this is especially important for collaborative projects that involve many researchers, institutions, and/or groups.

Examples of roles in data management:

- data collector
- metadata generator
- data analyzer
- project director
- data model and/or database designer
- computing staff responsible for backup and/or storage
- staff responsible for running instruments
- administrative support staff responsible for grant submission
- specialized skills as defined in the plan (GIS, relational database design/implementation, computer programming of sensors/input forms, etc)
- external data center or archive

Steps for assigning data management responsibilities:

1. For each task identified in your data management plan, identify the skills needed to perform the task
2. Match skills needed to available staff and identify gaps
3. Develop training/hiring plan
4. Develop staffing/training budget and incorporate into project budget
5. Assign responsible parties and monitor results

## Description Rationale 
A successful data management plan requires that the appropriate staffing resources are available and trained. Identifying specific tasks and responsible parties will help with budgeting, implementation, and preservation of the data resources.

## Related Best Practices: 
Plan data management early in your project
Plan for effective multimedia management
Provide budget information for your data management plan
Revisit data management plan throughout the project life cycle
