### What is "Plan"?

Map out the processes and resources for the entire data life cycle. Start with the project goals (desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and work backwards to build a data management plan, supporting data policies, and sustainability plans.

More information can be found in the [Best Practices Primer](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf) and [Data Management Guide](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE-PPSR-DataManagementGuide.pdf).
