Perform basic quality assurance and quality control on your data (see here), during data collection, entry, and analysis. Describe any conditions during collection that might affect the quality of the data. Identify values that are estimated, double-check data that are entered by hand (preferably entered by more than one person), and use quality level flags (see here) to indicate potential problems. Check the format of the data to be sure it is consistent across the data set. Perform statistical and graphical summaries (e.g. max/min, average, range) to check for questionable or impossible values and to identify outliers. Communicate data quality using either coding within the data set that indicates quality, or in the metadata or data documentation. Identify missing values. Check data using similar data sets to identify potential problems. Additional problems with the data may also be identified during analysis and interpretation of the data prior to manuscript preparation.
