### What is "Preserve"?

Plan to preserve data data in the short term to minimize potential losses (e.g., via accidents), and in the long term so that project stakeholders and others can access, interpret, and use the data in the future. Decide what data to preserve, where to preserve it, and what documentation needs to accompany the data. Map out the processes and resources for the entire data life cycle.  

More information can be found in the [Best Practices Primer](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf) and [Data Management Guide](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE-PPSR-DataManagementGuide.pdf).
